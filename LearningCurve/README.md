# LearningCurve

Sometimes I think things are hard to learn, but eventually it really wasnÂ´t. Everything I enjoyed doing per semester and where I actually learned valueble things are being put in small reports in this folder. Sometimes this folder also has some source code, or some references to other folders with source code that has been used to managed my Learning Curve.
