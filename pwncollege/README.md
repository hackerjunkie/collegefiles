# PWN.COLLEGE FILES

This section of the repository contains everything I have researched/coded or otherwise written when it comes to
pwn.college.

I did pwn.college for the minor reverse engineering and exploitation at The Hague University of Applied Sciences (THUAS)
in 2022. I am planning on doing this after that as well.
